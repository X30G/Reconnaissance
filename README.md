üìù Notes

    Scripts are kept intentionally minimal for learning and extensibility.
    Tested on Windows 10, Kali Linux (2025.2), and Ubuntu 22.04 with PowerShell Core.

# üîé Reconnaissance

This repository contains tools and techniques used during the **Reconnaissance** phase of penetration testing. It includes both **active** scanning (via custom port scanners) and **passive** information gathering (OSINT).

---

## üõ†Ô∏è Tools Included

### 1. ‚öôÔ∏è Port Scanners

Custom-built scripts to identify open ports on a target system.

| Script | Language     | Platform        | Description |
|--------|--------------|-----------------|-------------|
| `portscan.ps1` | PowerShell    | Windows        | A basic TCP port scanner using native PowerShell commands. Designed for quick scans in Windows environments. |
| `portscan.sh`  | Bash          | Linux/macOS    | Bash-based TCP scanner using `/dev/tcp` or `nc`. Lightweight and portable. |
| `portscan_kali_pwsh.ps1` | PowerShell (Core) | Kali Linux (pwsh) | A PowerShell Core-compatible port scanner for use on Kali or any Linux distro with `pwsh`. |

Each script allows basic configuration (IP, port range) and outputs open ports in a readable format.

### 2. üåê OSINT Techniques

Passive information gathering tools and notes, including:
- **Whois Lookups**
- **DNS Enumeration** (`nslookup`, `dig`, `dnsenum`)
- **Google Dorking**
- **Shodan & Censys Queries**
- **theHarvester** usage examples
- Notes on passive vs active recon

Scripts and example commands will be added in the `/osint` folder as development continues.

## üß™ Example Usage

```powershell
# Windows, Bash, PowerShell for Kali Linux (pwsh)
 -----------------------
 1. Set Target and Ports
 -----------------------

Replace this with the IP or hostname of your target machine
$target = "192.168.1.10"

Change the port range as needed
$ports = 1..1000

Set timeout (in milliseconds) to avoid freezing on unresponsive ports
$timeout = 1000

Write-Host "`n[*] Scanning $target for open TCP ports from $($ports[0]) to $($ports[-1])..." -ForegroundColor Cyan
